      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was tasked to create New Relic deployment markers for our applications that have APM enabled. Just to give a background, I am pretty much new to New Relic and found the deployment markers pretty helpful when you want to know (and bl@me!) if someone has added a change that has compromised the performance of your application, &amp;lsquo;coz it&amp;rsquo;s all about traceability these days! Hurrah!
