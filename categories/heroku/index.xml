      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team I was working with has a test that has been failing for months because said test is looking for a service that does not exist in the test environment it is running on. In local development, the developers have setup mock services for them but they have not setup anything that can be consumed by the app deployed in the test environment. It was a bit disturbing for me seeing a test failing for months without having any idea why it was like that or why it is left in that state.
