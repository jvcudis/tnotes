Recently, I've been playing with [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions) and the first thing that I've thought of doing is how I can use Github Actions aka **Steve** (let's name it Steve because Github Actions is just too unfriendly! ) to deploy my statically-generated site to Github Pages. The current deployment workflow involves TravisCI handling the generation of static files and deploying them to the `gh-pages` branch using a [built-in configuration](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).

The new planned workflow is pretty straightforward.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1,style=rainbow_dash" >}}
name: Build and Deploy to Github Pages
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master
    paths-ignore:
    - 'README.md'

jobs:
  ...
  deploy:
    name: Build & Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      GITHUB_USER: 'Some User'
      GITHUB_EMAIL: 'someuser@gmail.com'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Build static site and deploy to gh-pages
      run: |
        echo "üçô Building static files"
        npm ci --silent
        npm run build

        echo "üç© Deploying build directory to gh-pages branch"
        cd build
        git init
        git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
        git config user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add .
        git commit --allow-empty -m 'Deploying to GitHub pages'
        git push --force --quiet "https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git" "master:gh-pages"
        rm -rf .git
    ...

[LINE 16] The GITHUB_TOKEN is provided with no additional setup but it needs to be explicitly defined if you want to use it.
[LINE 34] We push changes using the GITHUB_TOKEN as the x-access-token.

Read more about [LINE 16](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret) and [LINE 34](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#http-based-git-access-by-an-installation).

But, here's the catch! When Steve pushed changes to the `gh-pages` branch, it did not trigger a page build at all.  (-_-)„Çû„Çõ

There is an error in the **Github Pages** settings page saying that the `Page build failed`. Honestly, it bugged me to death on why this is happening! I ran the deploy script locally just to see if the issue can be replicated but **_it works on my machine_**. But whenever I push the generated static content using the terminal, the error is gone! So it's definitely not an issue with the deploy script. ( „Éª‚óá„Éª)Ôºü

I got frustrated and so I switched the Github Pages source from `gh-pages` to `master` and, lo and behold, it triggered a Github Pages workflow even though it was not set up and that seemed to remove the page build error. Around this time, I did not know that **when you enable GitHub Actions, GitHub installs a GitHub App** on your repository. That is the reason behind having a Github Pages workflow running whenever a page build is triggered.

It got me thinking... Œ£(Ôø£„ÄÇÔø£Ôæâ)

Maybe you need to explicitly trigger a page build!

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1,style=rainbow_dash" >}}
     ...

       git push --force --quiet "https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git" "master:gh-pages"
       rm -rf .git
       curl -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
            -H Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
            -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/pages/builds

     ...
{{< / highlight >}}

So I added an API call to trigger a page build but it resulted in a message saying `Resource not accessible by integration`.

Now we are getting somewhere. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by Steve has definitely some permission limitations. Now, what do I do to have the correct permissions?  It got me into reading the different [authentication methods](https://developer.github.com/apps/migrating-oauth-apps-to-github-apps/#understand-the-different-methods-of-authentication) which resulted in me thinking that perhaps Steve (it being some sort of CI) has a server-to-server requests access but what we really want is [user-to-server requests](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/#user-to-server-requests) which means that we need to generate an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1,style=rainbow_dash" >}}
    ...

    env:
      ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      GITHUB_USER: 'Some User'
      GITHUB_EMAIL: 'someuser@gmail.com'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Build static site and deploy to gh-pages

      ...

      git push --force --quiet "https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git" "master:gh-pages"
      rm -rf .git
      curl -H "Authorization: token ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
           -H Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
           -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/pages/builds

    ...

It did solve the problem. As you can see, in the screenshot below, the Github Pages workflow has been triggered and there were no errors in the settings page.

But it still does not solve the root problem of why pushing changes from my local machine works and not when Steve does it. I did a bit of googling and discovered that [GitHub Actions created by other people](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) use the `ACCESS_TOKEN` when doing a `git push`.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1,style=rainbow_dash" >}}
    ...

      git push --force --quiet "https://${ACCESS_TOKEN:-"x-access-token:$GITHUB_TOKEN"}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git" "master:gh-pages"
      rm -rf .git

    ...

[LINE 3] If ACCESS_TOKEN is given then use it, otherwise use the GITHUB_TOKEN.
{{< / highlight >}}

And it worked! Now, there is no need to trigger a page build using the Github API as long as you use the ACCESS_TOKEN in pushing changes.

Problem solved. Root cause identified. Now, on to more problem-solving! Ôºº(~o~)Ôºè
